// We are modularizing this manually because the current modularize setting in Emscripten has some issues:
// https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/5820
// In addition, When you use emcc's modularization, it still expects to export a global object called `Module`,
// which is able to be used/called before the WASM is loaded.
// The modularization below exports a promise that loads and resolves to the actual sql.js module.
// That way, this module can't be used before the WASM is finished loading.

// We are going to define a function that a user will call to start loading initializing our Sql.js library
// However, that function might be called multiple times, and on subsequent calls, we don't actually want it to instantiate a new instance of the Module
// Instead, we want to return the previously loaded module

// TODO: Make this not declare a global if used in the browser

        // The way to affect the loading of emcc compiled modules is to create a variable called `Module` and add
        // properties to it, like `preRun`, `postRun`, etc
        // We are using that to get notified when the WASM has finished loading.
        // Only then will we return our promise

        // If they passed in a moduleConfig object, use that
        // Otherwise, initialize Module to the empty object
        var Module = typeof moduleConfig !== 'undefined' ? moduleConfig : {};

        // EMCC only allows for a single onAbort function (not an array of functions)
        // So if the user defined their own onAbort function, we remember it and call it
        var originalOnAbortFunction = Module['onAbort'];
        Module['onAbort'] = function (errorThatCausedAbort) {
            reject(new Error(errorThatCausedAbort));
            if (originalOnAbortFunction){
              originalOnAbortFunction(errorThatCausedAbort);
            }
        };

        Module['postRun'] = Module['postRun'] || [];
        Module['postRun'].push(function () {
            // When Emscripted calls postRun, this promise resolves with the built Module
            resolveModule(Module);
        });

        // There is a section of code in the emcc-generated code below that looks like this:
        // (Note that this is lowercase `module`)
        // if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {
        //     module['exports'] = Module;
        // }
        // When that runs, it's going to overwrite our own modularization export efforts in shell-post.js!
        // The only way to tell emcc not to emit it is to pass the MODULARIZE=1 or MODULARIZE_INSTANCE=1 flags,
        // but that carries with it additional unnecessary baggage/bugs we don't want either.
        // So, we have three options:
        // 1) We undefine `module`
        // 2) We remember what `module['exports']` was at the beginning of this function and we restore it later
        // 3) We write a script to remove those lines of code as part of the Make process.
        //
        // Since those are the only lines of code that care about module, we will undefine it. It's the most straightforward
        // of the options, and has the side effect of reducing emcc's efforts to modify the module if its output were to change in the future.
        // That's a nice side effect since we're handling the modularization efforts ourselves
        module = undefined;

        // The emcc-generated code and shell-post.js code goes below,
        // meaning that all of it runs inside of this promise. If anything throws an exception, our promise will abort
